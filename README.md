In this project we built a supermarket consisting of customers and cashiers which are considered as processes, they managed to communicate betweeen each other using message queues , shared memory and semaphores.
There were rules on how to actually divide customers over the cashiers and when to kill some processes and send signals between them
it was built using c language under linux operating system 
SKILLS ADDED : we learned how to deal with bigger formats of codes and how to collabrate with my team mates( Ahmed Zubaidia and Lana Badwan) in order to get the best result that can be obtained.
